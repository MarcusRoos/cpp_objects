## About This Repository
This is your personal student repository which will be used to submit solutions for the course's various assignments, 
both labs and the final project. This repo is completely private, meaning none other than you and the teachers have access to it.
As you've completed a particular assignment and wish to have its solution evaluated, you'll need to perform a formal 
hand-in using the dedicated submission box in Moodle. Nothing should be attached to this submission in Moodle, as the 
current project state will be fetched from this repository, so make sure to synchronize any local changes with **remote origin** 
before submission.
